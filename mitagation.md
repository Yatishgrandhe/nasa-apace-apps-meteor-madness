The page describes how NASA uses open science data to detect, track, and potentially deflect asteroids that could threaten Earth.


It uses the case of asteroid 2024 YR4 as an example: early observations suggested a >3% chance of impact in 2032, but additional data drove the estimated risk down to near zero.


Detection & Tracking
 ‚ÄÇ ‚Ä¢ Asteroids and comets whose orbits bring them near Earth (NEOs) are monitored.

 ‚ÄÇ ‚Ä¢ The Minor Planet Center collects positional observations globally; NASA‚Äôs Small Bodies Node shares those data openly.

 ‚ÄÇ ‚Ä¢ If an object‚Äôs trajectory seems concerning, NASA‚Äôs Center for Near¬≠Earth Object Studies (CNEOS) analyzes the orbit and reports to the Planetary Defense Coordination Office. 

 ‚ÄÇ ‚Ä¢ The International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) enables collaboration among observers worldwide.


Risk assessment & data sharing
 ‚ÄÇ ‚Ä¢ Uncertainty in an object‚Äôs future path is narrowed by accumulating more observations. 

‚ÄÇ  ‚Ä¢ Open data practices allow scientists everywhere to validate, compare, and refine impact probabilities. 

Deflection techniques & missions
 ‚ÄÇ ‚Ä¢ NASA‚Äôs DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) mission in 2022 successfully altered the orbit of asteroid Dimorphos, proving a kinetic impact strategy works. 

 ‚ÄÇ ‚Ä¢ NASA is developing NEO Surveyor, a space telescope set to launch (planned for 2027) whose mission is to discover and catalogue potentially hazardous asteroids. Its data will be publicly available.

NASA tracks Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) like asteroids and comets to protect Earth.


The Planetary Defense Coordination Office (PDCO) manages detection, tracking, and mitigation.


Challenges:
Limited staff and funding make it hard to fully execute planetary defense plans.


Smaller NEOs are harder to detect and track.


More research is needed to develop effective ways to prevent impacts.


Recommendations:
Increase funding and staffing for PDCO.


Strengthen international partnerships for global NEO detection and response.


Raise public awareness about asteroid/comet risks and planetary defense efforts.
üìÑ Study Overview
Objective: Develop a practical mitigation strategy for hazardous Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) detected with less than 5 years' warning time.


Context: Triggered by events like the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor explosion and the near miss of asteroid 2012 DA14, highlighting the need for rapid response capabilities.

üõ°Ô∏è Proposed Mitigation Strategy: Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle (HAIV)
Concept: A two-part spacecraft designed to intercept and neutralize a threatening NEO.


Kinetic Impactor: The leading section of HAIV delivers a high-speed impact to the NEO's surface.


Nuclear Explosive Device (NED): The trailing section carries a nuclear device designed for subsurface detonation.


Objective: Disrupt the NEO's structure and trajectory to prevent Earth impact.



‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details
Launch Vehicle: The mission would utilize the Atlas V 401 rocket for deployment.


Flight Timeline:


Launch: August 2, 2019.


Cruise Phase: Approximately 121 days outbound toward the target NEO.


Interception: Two-hour terminal guidance phase to ensure precise impact and detonation.


Key Challenges:


Uncertainty in NEO Characteristics: Limited knowledge of the NEO's size, shape, and rotation state at launch.


High Relative Velocity: Ensuring accurate timing for the nuclear detonation in the presence of significant velocity differences.



üåç Global Coordination and Future Directions
International Collaboration: The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG) are working to coordinate global responses to NEO threats.


Recommendations:


Enhanced Detection Systems: Development of advanced telescopes and observational tools to improve NEO detection rates.


Public Awareness Campaigns: Initiatives to educate the public on NEO risks and preparedness measures.


Dedicated NEO Survey Telescope: Advocacy for a space-based telescope positioned far from Earth's vicinity to monitor NEOs more effectively.
